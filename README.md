## S01 - Part A
create a dictionary called `word_counter` that counts the number of words in `lyrics`.
- remove all puntuation using `string punctuation`
- lowercase the entire string
- split by `" "`


```python

# Clean my Data

cleaned_lyrics = lyrics.replace("\n", " ").lower()
from string import punctuation
for punc in punctuation:
    cleaned_lyrics = cleaned_lyrics.replace(punc, "")

words = cleaned_lyrics.split(" ")
    # build your word_counter here
# Your code here
word_counter = {}
for word in words:
    word_counter[word] = word_counter.get(word,0) + 1
word_counter
```
